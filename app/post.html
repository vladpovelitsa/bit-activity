			<p>Nissan announced the company's development plan for 2020-2023, which includes the departure of the Datsun brand from the Russian market.</p>

			<p>The company took into account the unstable situation in the market and the decline in car sales, writes TASS. “For this, we decided to complete the production of Datsun models at the end of calendar year 2020 and to consolidate all resources to strengthen the Nissan and Infiniti brands,” the agency quotes the company.</p>

			<p>Nissan will continue to ship Datsun to dealers until March 2021. In retail, cars will be available until they are completely sold out.</p>

			<p>Reuters wrote about the possible closure of the Datsun brand and a change in the company's priorities in October 2019. Agency sources indicated that Nissan is preparing a “recovery plan” after the aggressive expansion of markets by the former head of the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance, Carlos Ghosn.</p>

			<p>Nissan eliminated the Datsun brand in 1981 to promote its own brand, Kommersant pointed out, but in 2013, Ghosn introduced a new car under this brand in India.</p>

			<p>Datsun sales in Russia started in 2014, reminiscent of Vedomosti. In Russia, cars of the brand are assembled at the AvtoVAZ site - this is an on-DO sedan and a mi-DO hatchback. The sales record was reached in 2015: 32 thousand cars. In 2019, 22.4 thousand were sold, the newspaper notes. For comparison, Granta sales amounted to about 135.8 thousand cars.</p>
